# ft-scss-tools

Just a collection of SASS (SCSS syntax) utility mixins and functions.

Out of the box, this library should NOT create any CSS when compiled. You'll need to use the mixins/functions in order to take advantage of this library.

## Installation

Compass must be installed on your machine first.

```bash
$ bower install -S https://github.com/ft-interactive/ft-scss-tools.git
```
